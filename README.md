# PHY-2200-Profolio

# Intorduction

For Computational Physics PHY-2200 at High Point University, we were given 5 projects which were combined into our portfolio. Each branch consists of each of the projects which were assigned during our time in the class. Mike Blanchard and I worked on each of these projects together. 

# Projects

[Project 00 Planko Board](https://github.com/rkobbe/PHY-2200-Profolio/blob/main/PlankoBoard.ipynb)

For this project, Mike and I decided to look into the Plinko Board. A Plinko board is a game where the player takes a chip or a ball and drops a box that has pins located in it. The ball then bounces off of each of the pins until it reaches the bottom of the board. 

We wanted to study collisions and the force of gravity with this project. What effects does the starting position have on the way the ball collides with the rods? Below we will discuss the scientific process we went through from measuring the ball drop. 

[Project 01 Double Pendulum](https://github.com/rkobbe/PHY-2200-Profolio/blob/main/DoublePendulum.ipynb)

The goal for the project was to use multiple differential equations and an RK4 [ODE](https://github.com/rkobbe/PHY-2200-Profolio/blob/main/ode%20(1).py) method to model a double pendulum. We wanted to investigate the motion of a double pendulum and see how changing parameters would effect the model.

[Project 02 CurveBall](https://github.com/rkobbe/PHY-2200-Profolio/blob/main/CurveBall.ipynb) 

Our goal was to model the trajectory a curveball pitch with an [ODE](https://github.com/rkobbe/PHY-2200-Profolio/blob/main/ode.py). This includes viewing where the ball crosses the plate, a side view, and a top down view. After completing a single mode, we plotted mulitple pitches; specially we looked at where in the strike zone the curveball crossed. Additionally, we used different spinerates and velocities to get acurate data. We collected our data from the top 10 pitcher's average curveball leaderboard from Baseball Savant

[Project 03 Coupled Oscillators](https://github.com/rkobbe/PHY-2200-Profolio/blob/main/CoupledOscillators.ipynb)

In this project, we designed a system that uses coupled oscillators. In class, we investigated osculators that were free on both ends. For our project, we wanted to see the effects a fixed left end had on the eigenvalues, our graph, and our model for each mode. We were able to test different parameters and draw conclusions on the different models.

Branch 04 the final branch holds our project on Brownian Motion 

In this project e research the question, How can we model Brownian Motion by simulating a pollen particle in water? We learn about the effects of Brownian Motion and how it came into effect.
